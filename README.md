# Agile-Web-Development
Assessments done during Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE.
The first assessment is a simple set of pages: a home page, a contacts page and four pages containing groups of questions.
Each question is a cascading box with the answer in the cascade.

The second assessment is a collection of sprints done collaboratively with other students. Each sprint had a different member leading the project, with sprint 1 being the section I was the leader for. The project was to create a web page that displayed various works of art from famous historical painters. The user could upload new works, edit or delete existing work, filter by painting style or artist, and a search mechanism to find a painting based on the name.

The third assessment is similar to the first, excempt the answers for the questions are called from a database as opposed to being hard coded onto the page.
